    categories:
        descriptions:
            bug: |
                Execution breaks: Code throws unhandled exceptions
                Wrong results: Output doesn't match expected behavior
                Resource leaks: Unclosed files, connections, memory accumulation
                State corruption: Invalid object/data states
                Logic errors: Control flow produces incorrect outcomes
                Race conditions: Concurrent access causes inconsistent state or duplicates
                Incorrect measurements: Metrics/timings that don't reflect actual operations
                Invariant violations: Broken constraints (size limits, uniqueness, etc.)
                Async timing bugs: Variables captured incorrectly in async closures
            performance: |
                Algorithm complexity: O(n²) when O(n) is possible
                Redundant operations: Duplicate calculations or unnecessary loops
                Memory waste: Large allocations or leaks over time
                Blocking operations: Synchronous I/O in critical paths
                Database inefficiency: N+1, missing indexes, full scans
                Cache misses: Not leveraging available caching mechanisms
            security: |
                Injection vulnerabilities: SQL/NoSQL/command/LDAP injection
                AuthZ/AuthN flaws: Missing checks, privilege escalation
                Data exposure: Sensitive data in logs, responses, or errors
                Crypto issues: Weak algorithms, hardcoded keys, improper validation
                Input validation gaps: Missing sanitization or bounds checks
                Session management: Predictable tokens or missing expiration

                Critical operation failure (auth/payment/authorization)
                Direct financial loss operations
                Memory leaks that inevitably crash production
